# Contributing to Silkthemes
Thank you for contributing to the project!

## Theme submissions
Your theme must meet the following requirements:
- Should not have any license violations or copyright issues whatsoever (if any exist, please resolve them before submitting)
- Should be fully compatible with the latest version of Zen Browser as of applying
- Should include some form of functionality, such as adding new features or a color scheme
  - This does not include satirical functionality, such as hiding every element or adding an intentionally low contrast color scheme
- Should be public-source/source-available or open-source
- Public source is solely making your source code public to all, while open source is licensing that code under an open source license (such as MIT, GPL, etc)
- May include others' rices/mods as long as the project is not solely a compilation of others' works
  - In other words, you must add your own original code as well (includes compatibility fixes for CSS you've used)

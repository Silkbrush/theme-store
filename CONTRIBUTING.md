# Contributing to Silkthemes
Thank you for contributing to the project!

## Theme submissions
Your submission must meet the following requirements to be accepted.

### Functionality
Your theme should include some form of functionality, such as adding new features or a color scheme. This
does not include satirical functionality, such as hiding every element or adding an intentionally low
contrast color scheme.

Your theme may include satirical functionality (such as setting the font to Comic Sans as a joke) as long as
it does not adversely affect the accessibility of the browser.

### Licensing & Copyright
Your submission should not have any license violations or copyright issues whatsoever (if any exist, please
resolve them before submitting). For example, if your submission does not follow the license terms of the
works used in your theme, or if your theme's license terms are not compatible with ours (AGPLv3), we cannot
accept your theme.

Your theme may include works from other projects, as long as the project follows the licenses' terms and is
not solely a compilation of others' works (meaning you must add your own original code as well).

Your submission must also be public-source (source code is publicly available **WITHOUT** an open source
license) or open-source (source code is publicly available **WITH** an open source license)

### Compatibility
Your theme should be fully compatible with the latest version of Zen Browser as of submitting. If your theme
only works on older versions, we cannot accept your theme.

## Reporting broken themes
If a theme is broken, you can report it using the "Report borked theme" issue template to let us know. We
will review your report then ask the theme creator to submit a patch as soon as possible. If this cannot be
done within a reasonable timeframe, we may remove the theme from the store.

If possible, please consider reporting the issue directly to the theme developer first.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Please ensure any theme breakages are not caused by theme conflicts.** If you are unsure, try testing
> the theme on a clean profile without any other custom themes/CSS applied.

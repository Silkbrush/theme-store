  Silkthemes theme store
</h1>
<p align="center">
  A custom theme store for Zen Browser with userContent support
</p>

## Why use Silkthemes?
Zen Mods has various issues, such as:
- No support for userContent styles
- More manual theme update process
- Poor vetting process (many submission PRs are left open for months on end)
- Vague/nonexistent submission guidelines
- Harder to submit larger projects (like [Natsumi](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser) and
  [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Nebula-A-Minimal-Theme-for-Zen-Browser))

Silkthemes is an alternative to Zen Mods which aims to solve many of these issues. It's not perfect, but we
still aim to make it the best place possible to install and share themes for Zen Browser.
